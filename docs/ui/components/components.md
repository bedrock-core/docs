# Components

This is a list of the built-in components that you can use in your JSX.

## Built-in components

- [**`<Panel>`**](./Panel.md) basic container with a background.
- [**`<Text>`**](./Text.md) display text content.
- [**`<Button>`**](./Button.md) create interactive buttons that respond to player clicks with the `onPress` callback.
- [**`<Image>`**](./Image.md) display textures and images from your resource pack.
- [**`<Fragment>`**](./Fragment.md), alternatively written as `<>...</>`, lets you group multiple JSX nodes together without adding an extra wrapper.

## Control Props

All components support (and currently [v0.2.0] require some) [**Control Props**](./control-props.md) for layout and visibility control.

See [Control Props](./control-props.md) for detailed documentation and examples.
