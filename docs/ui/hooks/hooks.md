# Hooks

State and effects management for your components.

## Built-in Hooks

### State Management

- [`useState`](./useState.md) - Manage component state.
- [`useReducer`](./useReducer.md) - Manage complex state logic with a reducer function.
- [`useContext`](./useContext.md) - Access context values from Context.

### Effects & Lifecycle

- [`useEffect`](./useEffect.md) - Perform side effects in function components with cleanup support.
- [`useExit`](./useExit.md) - Request the UI to be closed.

### References

- [`useRef`](./useRef.md) - Create a mutable reference that is persisted across executions.

### Minecraft specific

- [`usePlayer`](./usePlayer.md) - Access the current player who is viewing the UI.
- [`useEvent`](./useEvent.md) - Subscribe to global Minecraft events within your UI components.
